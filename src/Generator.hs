 - We may have several bots, and commands to these bots are to be issued sort of "in parallel":
 -
 - Bot 1: C C C _ _ C C C C ...
 - Bot 2:   C C C C _ _ C C ...
 - Bot 3:     C _ C C _ C C ...
 -
 - where _ stands for Wait and C stands for some other command.
 - Initially we have just one bot, other start working later.
 - Number of bots can also be decreased sometimes.
