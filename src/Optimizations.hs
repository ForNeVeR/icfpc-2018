-- | Optimizations for sequences of commands.

-- Each optimizations replaces first occurrence of a pattern with an optimized

-- The latter consumes 4 less energy points than the former.
--
-- Note: it doesn't make sense to split [LMove a b] into two SMoves because the
-- extra step will consume 3 RÂ³ energy points, which is detrimental for any
-- R greater than one.
